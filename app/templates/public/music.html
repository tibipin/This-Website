        Although I hardly can find the time and patience for it anymore, I used to enjoy making music.<br>
        As you can hear from my top 10 most played songs on spotify, I'm influenced by gypsy and electronic music, 
        but I also like the lo-fi nature of bedroom-made instrumentals.
        <br>
        Over 90% of my music features the electric guitar, an instrument which I've been playing since highschool.
